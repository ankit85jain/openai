            "\n",
            "1. **Column Selection**: Since we are only interested in the top 5 customers based on sales, you could optimize the query by selecting only the necessary columns in the final output. In this case, selecting just the `customer_name` would be sufficient as we are ranking customers based on sales.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Indexing**: To improve query performance, ensure that the columns used in join conditions and filtering (such as `user_id`, `order_id`, `product_id`, `created_at`) are properly indexed in the respective tables.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Subquery vs. Common Table Expression (CTE)**: While using a CTE is a good practice for readability and maintainability, in some cases, using a subquery might perform better depending on the database engine's query optimizer. You can test both approaches to see which one works more efficiently for your dataset.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Joins**: The query uses INNER JOINs to retrieve the data. Ensure that the join conditions are correct and that there are no unnecessary joins that could impact performance.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Group By**: Since the query is already aggregating sales at the customer level, the GROUP BY clause is necessary. Ensure that the grouping is done correctly to avoid incorrect results.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Performance Tuning**: Consider the volume of data in your tables. If the tables are large, optimizing the query by creating indexes, partitioning tables, or using query hints can improve performance.\n",

If, like in the scenario above, the reflection step simply prompts the LLM to reflect on its output, it can still benefit the output quality (since the LLM then has multiple \"shots\" at getting a good output), but it's less guaranteed.\n"
